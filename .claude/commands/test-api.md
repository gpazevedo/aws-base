description: Test the deployed API endpoints
---

Please help me test the deployed API by:

1. Getting the API endpoint URL from Terraform outputs
2. Testing all health check endpoints (/health, /liveness, /readiness)
3. Testing application endpoints (/, /greet)
4. Checking if API Key authentication is enabled
5. Running the automated test suite if available
6. Showing me how to view logs in CloudWatch

Provide curl commands and expected responses.
