---

Please help me run code quality checks:

1. Check if pre-commit hooks are installed
2. Run linting with Ruff
3. Run type checking with Pyright
4. Run unit tests with pytest
5. Show me any issues found
6. Help me fix common issues
7. Explain the code quality standards

Use the Makefile commands where available.
