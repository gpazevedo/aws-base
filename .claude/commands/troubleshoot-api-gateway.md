description: Troubleshoot API Gateway issues
---

I'm having issues with API Gateway. Please help me:

1. Check if API Gateway is enabled in the Terraform configuration
2. Verify the Lambda permissions for API Gateway
3. Check the API Gateway deployment status
4. Review CloudWatch logs for errors
5. Test the Lambda function directly (bypassing API Gateway)
6. Check for common issues (403 errors, rate limiting, integration problems)
7. Provide solutions for any issues found

Include diagnostic commands and how to fix common problems.
