description: Build and push Docker images for a service
---

I need to build and push a Docker image. Please:

1. Ask me which service (api, worker, etc.)
2. Ask me which environment (dev, test, prod)
3. Ask me which Dockerfile to use (lambda, apprunner, eks)
4. Show me the build command with the correct architecture
5. Explain the tagging strategy
6. Show me how to push to ECR
7. Verify the image was pushed successfully

Include both Makefile shortcuts and direct script usage.
