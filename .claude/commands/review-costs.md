description: Review AWS infrastructure costs and optimization opportunities
---

Please help me understand and optimize my AWS costs:

1. Check which compute options are enabled (Lambda, App Runner, EKS)
2. Estimate costs based on current configuration
3. Identify potential cost optimization opportunities
4. Compare costs across different compute options
5. Show me how to monitor actual costs in AWS
6. Suggest cost-effective alternatives if applicable

Provide realistic cost estimates based on the README documentation.
