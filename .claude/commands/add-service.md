description: Add a new backend service to the project
---

I want to add a new backend service. Please help me:

1. Ask me for the service name
2. Create the directory structure under backend/
3. Copy and customize the necessary files (main.py, pyproject.toml, etc.)
4. Update the Dockerfiles if needed
5. Show me how to build and test the new service
6. Explain how to deploy it to AWS
7. Update documentation as needed

Walk me through the entire process step by step.
